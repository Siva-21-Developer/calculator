**Project Description:**

The project aims to develop a basic calculator application using the Flutter framework. The calculator app will provide 
users with a simple interface to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Key Features:**

**User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface for the calculator app, featuring buttons for numeric digits (0-9),
arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), and special functions (e.g., clear, delete).

**Input Handling:** Implement logic to handle user input from button presses and display the inputted numbers and operations on the calculator screen in real time.

**Arithmetic Operations:** Implement the core functionality of the calculator, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Ensure accurate calculation of results based on user input.
